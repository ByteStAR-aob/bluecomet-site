Nice — clean repo. 👌
Yeah, this is exactly the moment to drop a README.md in there. It’ll make the project feel intentional and legit instead of “empty shell.”

Below is a ready-to-paste README.md tailored to what you’ve got right now (index.html, static site, GitHub Pages–ready), but also leaves room for where you’re clearly heading.
